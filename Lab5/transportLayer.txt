Explanations
------------
Source Port: 16 bit number, identifies the source port number.
Destination Port: 16 bit number, identifies the destination port number.
Sequence number: 32 bit number used for byte level numbering of TCP segments.
Acknowledgement Number: 32 bit number field which indicates the next sequence number that the sending device is expecting from the other device.
Header Length: 4 bit field which shows the number of 32 bit words in the header.
Flags: controls the entire process of connection establishement, data transmission, and connection termination.
ACK flag: Acknowledgement.
PSH flag: push function. data from a sending application will be pushed immediately without waiting to fill the segment.
Window: size of the recieve window.
Checksum: 16 bit field, used for error checking.
Urgent Pointer: shows the end of the urgent data so that interrupted data streams can continue.
Payload: data being sent.
