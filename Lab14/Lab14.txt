Q.1

No due to several factors:
- Transmission delay. The amount of time required to push all packet's
bits into the wire.
- propagation delays due to speed of communications link and light delays.
- queuing and processing at routers, source, & destnation nodes.
- transcoding delays due to data manipulation algorithms such as compression.

Q.2

Latency is directly related to consistency, if two players are playing an 
shooting game, a player with low latency will miss alot of his shots on 
a player with high latency. Two players with similar latency levels will
not experience such inconsistency.

Q.3

dumb client: conservative
client-side prediction: optimistic

dumb client: Client sends input to the server, the server calculates the 
state and sends it to the client, client just renders the state to it
from the server

client-side prediction: sends out inputs to the server, also applies
them immediately locally to update your own state. server can override
player input if simulation on server side has a constraint player does not
know about yet. when you recieve the update from the server, check if it
differs from local state. if different, correct local state.
