Q.1
---

client/server
-------------
+ Centralized data repo. Easier to maintain, more accountability,
better security.
+ Can control and record transactions by clients.
+ One server can work with wider variety of client capabilities.
+ Well-known port numbers.
- Centralized & less robust. Efficiency & reliability depond on server.
- popular data = more congestion, slower.


peer to peer
------------
+ Decentrilized & more robust. No single point of failure.
+ Popular data = more distribution, faster.
- Decentralized data. More redundancy, harder to maintain,
less accountability, less stability.
- Transactions are not recorded, harder to trace.
- Peers need to be farily compatible.
- Peers need to find each other, no well-known ports.

Host A is the authorative host. Host B connects to host A. Host C connects to
host A too. Host A knows the data (ip address, port numbers) of the hosts that
are connected to host A (host B & host C). Host A gives the data of host B to
host C and vice versa so that the two hosts can connect using eachother.
